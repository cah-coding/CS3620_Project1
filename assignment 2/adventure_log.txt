Ashwood Manor Adventure Log
==========================

 --- Story Beginning --- 
You arrive at Ashwood Manor under the relentless downpour. The grand, looming house creaks as if it has secrets of its own.
The count greets you with a nervous look and says he last saw his son Charlie with Jake, Charlie's best friend...
A storm rumbles in the distance as the mystery begins.
Do you go question Jake immediately, or search Charlieâ€™s room for clues first?

You decide to investigate Charlie's room, hoping his belongings will tell you more than his friend could...

Charlie's room smells strongly of smoke. Ash is smeared on his clothes as if he had been sitting near a fire recently...

Fueled by suspicion, you storm down the hallway toward Jake's room...

Jake finally cracks under pressure. He confesses that Charlie left with Dee after the firepit and that they were headed toward the old bunker beneath the manor.

You scour the manor looking for Dee, your footsteps echoing through the empty halls...

While searching the house, you find a crumpled note that reads: 'Stop looking if you know what's good for you.' Moments later, you run into Dee...

You calmly ask Dee if she knows who might have written such a note...

Dee insists she had nothing to do with it, then suggests you question the count himself...

You keep searching the manor, unwilling to give up just yet...

Despite your best efforts, no new clues turn up. The trail has gone cold...
Charlie remains missing, and the case remains unsolved.
